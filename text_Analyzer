# Text Analyzer - Code Readability Exercise

## Problem
#You need to build a text analyzer that processes articles or documents and provides detailed statistics. 
#This is a perfect example of how functions can transform a long, complex program into something readable and maintainable.

## Requirements
#The program should analyze text and provide:

#1. **Basic Statistics:**
   - Word count
   - Character count (with and without spaces)
   - Sentence count
   - Paragraph count

#2. **Advanced Analysis:**
   - Average words per sentence
   - Most common words (top 5)
   - Reading difficulty estimate (based on average word length)
   - Text sentiment (simple positive/negative word counting)

#3. **Formatted Report:**
   - Clean, professional output
   - Percentage breakdowns
   - Easy-to-read summary

### Expected Behavior
#```
#Text Analyzer
#=============

#Enter your text (press Enter twice to finish):
#This is a sample text for analysis. It contains multiple sentences and various words. 
#Some words are repeated to test the frequency analysis. This tool helps writers 
#understand their writing style and improve readability.

#TEXT ANALYSIS REPORT
#====================

#BASIC STATISTICS:
#- Total words: 32
#- Characters (with spaces): 159
#- Characters (without spaces): 127
#- Sentences: 3
#- Paragraphs: 1

#ADVANCED ANALYSIS:
#- Average words per sentence: 10.7
#- Average word length: 4.0 characters
#- Reading difficulty: Easy
#- Text sentiment: Positive (60% positive words)

#MOST COMMON WORDS:
#1. "and" (3 times)
#2. "text" (2 times)
#3. "analysis" (2 times)
#4. "words" (2 times)
#5. "writing" (2 times)

#SUMMARY:
#Your text is easy to read with a positive tone. Consider varying sentence length for better flow.
#```

## The Challenge
#This exercise demonstrates how a program that could be 100+ lines of messy code becomes clean and readable when broken into focused functions. 
#Each function should have a single, clear purpose.



#print(dir(variable)  to know all the dggregation/ fuctiond u can perform on that variable.
