# Shopping Cart Calculator

## Problem
#You're building a shopping cart calculator for an online store. The program needs to:

#1. Calculate the subtotal of items
#2. Apply discounts based on different rules
#3. Calculate tax
#4. Add shipping costs
#5. Display a formatted receipt

## Requirements
#Without functions, this would involve repeating calculations and formatting code. Your task is to create functions that:

#1. Eliminate repetitive calculations
#2. Make the main program logic clear and easy to follow
#3. Handle the price calculations step by step

## Expected Behavior
#The program should allow users to add items to their cart, then display a detailed receipt with:
#- Item list with prices
#- Subtotal
#- Discount applied (if any)
#- Tax amount
#- Shipping cost
#- Final total

## Sample Run
#```

#- Calculating subtotals
