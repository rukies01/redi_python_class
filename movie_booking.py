"""
Problem Statement for a simple and modular movie ticket booking program is as below.

Favourite movies (good choices, guys :) ):
1. Terminator 2 
2. Interstellar
3. Blacklist
4. Home Alone
5. The Pursuit of Happiness

Showtimes:
M, A, E (M - Morning, A - Afternoon, E - Evening)

Features:
1. Available movies & showtimes
2. Seats - number of tickets, regular/vip/ dbox
3. Ticket price - 18 EUR, 25 EUR
4. Show the booking confirmation

Here's the code we came up with for a simple and modular movie ticket booking program 
"""
# Dictionary of movies and their showtimes 
# Note: This dictionary is declared outside of functions so that it can be accessed globally
# Feel free to experiment with declaring it inside a function, or passing it as a parameter to functions (will be covered in the 2nd class)

movies = {
        "Terminator 2": ["M", "E"],
        "Interstellar" : ["M", "A"],
        "Blacklist": ["M", "A", "E"],
        "Home Alone": ["E"],
        "The Pursuit of Happiness": ["M", "A"]
    }
# Remember the names are case-sensitive! The input should match exactly with the keys in this dictionary

# Function to display available movies and their showtimes to the user
def movie_program():
    print("This is today's movie program:")

    for movie in movies:
        print(f"{movie} at show slot {movies[movie]}");

# Function to ask user for chosen movie and showtime, and validate the input
def ask():
    title = input(f"What movie?"); # User input for movie title
    # After the user enters a movie title in the terminal, we check if it's valid
    # Don't forget to enter an input in the terminal :)

    if title in movies:
        print("Movie is valid");
        # TODO: This message could be improved by showing the available showtimes for the chosen movie.
        
        show_time = input(f"What time?");
        if show_time in movies[title]:
            print("Time is valid!");
            # I forgot to add this line during the live coding, but return the chosen title and show_time
            return title, show_time # return both title and show_time as a tuple
                  
        else:
            print("Time is invalid :( Try Again")
            return None # break out of the function

        return None # break out of the function
    
# Main program execution 
movie_program()
movie_info = ask() # Call the ask function and store the returned value

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is where we reached at the end of class   
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is an idea of how I would continue the program in the first way that comes to my mind
# Future steps:
# 1. Ask for number of tickets  
# 2. Ask for seat type (1st class/ vip/ dbox)
# 3. Calculate ticket price based on seat type and number of tickets
# 4. Show the booking confirmation

# Dictionary of seat types and their prices (again, declared outside of functions)
seat_types = {
    "regular": 15,
    "vip": 18,
    "dbox": 20
}

# Function to ask user for number of tickets and seat type, and validate the input
def get_seat_info():
    seat_number = input("How many tickets?");
    if not seat_number.isdigit() or int(seat_number) <= 0:
        print("Invalid number of tickets! Try Again")
        return None # break out of the function if invalid seat number
    else:
        seat_type = input(f"What type of seat? {list(seat_types.keys())}"); # show available seat types to the user
        if seat_type not in seat_types:
            print("Invalid seat type! Try Again")
            return None # break out of the function if invalid seat type
        else:
            #return seat_number, seat_type # return info as strings (default)
            return int(seat_number), seat_type # return seat_number as specified integer  

seat_info = get_seat_info() # Call the get_seat_info function and store the returned value
# You can add an if condition to check if movie_info is valid (not None) before proceeding to get seat info
# This is left out for simplicity, but feel free to experiment and implement it

# Function to calculate total price based on number of tickets and seat type
def calculate_total_price(seat_info):
    return seat_info[0] * seat_types[seat_info[1]]
    # seat_info is a tuple (seat_number, seat_type)
    # if seat_info[0] is not an integer (like if you use the code in line 99), 
    # this will raise an error! You can convert it to int using int(seat_info[0]) in this function if needed.

def show_booking_confirmation(movie_info, seat_info, total_price):
    print("\nBooking Confirmation:")
    print(f"Movie: {movie_info[0]}")
    print(f"Showtime: {movie_info[1]}")
    print(f"Number of tickets: {seat_info[0]}")
    print(f"Seat type: {seat_info[1]}")
    print(f"Total price: {total_price} EUR")
    print(f"Enjpoy your movie :)")
    # You can also call the calculate_total_price function here instead of passing total_price as a parameter


if movie_info and seat_info: 
    # Proceed only if both movie_info and seat_info are valid (that is, their return value is not None)    
    
    # Calculate total price
    total_price = calculate_total_price(seat_info) # Call the function to calculate total price
    
    # Optional: Unpack the tuples for easier access using the line below
    # title, show_time = movie_info # unpack the movie_info tuple into title and show_time
    # Else, you can access the same using movie_info[0] and movie_info[1] like below

    # Show booking confirmation manually
    #print("\nSucess! Your booking is confirmed!")
    #print(f"Movie: {movie_info}")
    #print(f"Showtime: {movie_info[1]}")
    #print(f"Number of tickets: {seat_info[0]}")
    #print(f"Seat type: {seat_info[1]}")
    #print(f"Total price: {total_price} EUR")
    #print(f"Enjpoy your movie :)")

    # Or, call the function to show booking confirmation
    show_booking_confirmation(movie_info, seat_info, total_price)

 # NOTE: The program currently does not loop back to ask for inputs again if the user enters invalid data.
 # This can be implemented using while loops, which we briefly discussed in the class.   
 # Feel free to experiment and let us know how it goes!
